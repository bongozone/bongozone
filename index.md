<span class="newthought">Pan-and-Shift</span> is a four voice, voltage-controlled
looping shift register for the <a href="http://www.vcvrack.com/">VCVRack</a> modular synthesis environment.
By carefully applying modulation to the Pan-and-Shift, automatic variations upon
melodic patterns may generated.

## Shift Registers

The Pan-and-Shift has 4 independent shift registers, denoted <em>lanes</em>. Each lane
has two channels. The left-hand channel is intended for a pitch CV, for generating a melody.
The right-hand channel may be utilized for a secondary modulation, or a pattern of gates.

Each lane has two parameters associated with it. The left-hand lane slider determines
the <em>length</em> of the shift register. In the fully lowered position, there are 16
stages. The right-hand slider, moves the location of the tap or the outputs. If the right tap
value is greater than the left length value, the tap will be set to the last stage
of the lane. Independent values for the tap position and the lane length will be
useful when we explore the looping feature.

## Pan and Scan Sections

Below the primary CV inputs there are two pan-and-scan<label for="sn-ps" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ps" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">See Make Noise RxMx, Verbos Pan and Scan, Toppobrillo Mixiplexer, etc.</span>
blocks, one for the channel inputs &amp; and one for the channel outputs. By adjusting the position of these knobs and applying
modulation to the inputs, you may control which <em>lanes</em> are receiving input
and which lanes are outputting. The state of each lane and its activity are
indicated by the LEDs above and below each channel.

When neither the input the output nor the input of a lane is active, a clock trigger
will not cause the state of a lane to change.<label for="sn-muted" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-muted" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><em class="danger">
  WARNING:</em> This functionality may change in future revisions to be controlled by a panel switch.
</span>

When the input for a lane is disabled but the output is enabled, a clock trigger
will advance the pattern normally, but the final memory cell of the lane will be
copied into the input, causing <em>looping</em>.

## Modes

The CV2 channel has three modes accessible from the panel switch:

<span class="newthought">CV</span> mode causes the right channel to operate indentically
to the left hand channel.

<span class="newthought">Velocity</span> mode outputs the stored CV while the
input clock is high.

<span class="newthought">Gate</span> mode outputs a 10-volt gate if the value
in the CV channel is high. When CV2 is normaled to the clock input, the CV2 channels
will generate short trigger pulses instead of gates.
