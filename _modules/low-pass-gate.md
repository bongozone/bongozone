description: 8 channels of Low Pass Gate w/ vactrol-style decay on the CV envelope.
index: 20
---

8 independent Low Pass Gates with an adjustable decay on the CV parameter.

## Normalling
Channels are also normalled to +5v so you can use them as a 303 style decay envelope.
 Output are mixed into 5 mix outputs that allow you to sum the gates as well as
 use non-audio channels apply compression/ducking to the bus output.
Gentle clipping is possible at the higher gain sections.
